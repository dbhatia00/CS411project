# Changes from Original Specifications

In this document , we aim to describe the ways in which we altered the applciation from the original design.

First and foremost, we elimated the friend-finding and comparison side of the application. Though this would have been a nice addition,
we felt as though we would not have the time to implement it correctly. 

Second, instead of having the user select a song from their playlists we allow the user to enter the name of a song. This gives the user 
more freedom in entering the songs that they want, instead of just what appears to be in their playlist.
