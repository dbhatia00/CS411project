# Choosing the Framework

## Options:
Django is a good option for applications that use relational databases, external libraries, and require fast processing. Node.js is useful for applications that use client-side processing, process a large magnitude of requests, and easy scalability. 

## How we decided:
Weâ€™ve decided to use Django over Node.js for now because our web application will use a database to store data about our users and their Spotify song selections. We plan to use MySQL which is officially supported by Django. Django also offers built in security features which is helpful since we are dealing with people's personal Spotify account information. We are also familiar with Python, and Django is a Python-based framework compared to Node.js which uses JavaScript. Our team will split up the work between front-end and back-end.
