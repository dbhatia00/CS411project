# CS411 Project Proposal
## Submitted by Dev Bhatia, Prath Dhungel, Ciaran Hikaru Ueda Fitzgerald, Dana Zheng


### Idea 1:
Spotify-Watson Compatibility

We were inspired by modern day college dating culture and wanted to make the matchmaking process more efficient. Our first idea consists of a spotify compatibility calculator that is capable of taking two users' spotify data and output a compatibility rating based on IBM Watson’s sentiment analysis. The two core API’s of this application will be the Spotify API and IBM Watson’s NLP API. For 3rd party authentication, we can utilize spotify. For database usage, we can store a user profile with compatibility data. Potential challenges include utilizing Watson in an effective way.

### Idea 2: 
Zillow-Greatschools School District Finder

Our second idea consists of making recommendations on where to live based on a user’s income, preferred zip code(s), and preferred down payment. The two API’s we would use for this project are the Great schools API and the Zillow API. For the database aspect we would create a user profile with various user preferences. We will show the user potential living areas alongside academic information (provided by Greatschools) associated with those districts. A potential challenge would be specifying user input, and how we would rank which locations are best based on the data we gather from Zillow.
