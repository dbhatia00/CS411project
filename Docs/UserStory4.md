# User Story 4 - Reports Page
From the friends list page (see user story 3) the user will be able to select a specific friend to calculate their compatibility with.

## Happy Path - 

- As a logged-in user, the user wants to be able to view what tones are present in a selected song (ex. Joy, anger, tentative, etc.)
- The page should display all of the user’s searched songs as well as the top three tones present in the song and the respective score for each tone 
- At the bottom of the page there will be a button called “Enter another song” which will direct the user back to the main page (see user story 3 ) so that they can enter another song title
- Lastly, there will also be a logout button at the bottom of the page so that the user can log-out of the application if desired (see user story 2)


## Exceptions - 
- If the user tries to access the report page when the database is empty, then we will show an error message that the database is empty
