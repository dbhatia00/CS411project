# User Story 3 - Friends List
The main page will greet the user by saying “Hi -username-.” It will have a search box for the user to search for a song title and a submit button to submit the search request. The main page also has a “See Report” button that will bring the user to the Report Page. Lastly, there is a logout button at the bottom of the page for the user to log out. 

## Happy path:
- When the user arrives at the Main Page, they will see a message that says “Search a song” and a search box called “Enter a Song Title.” 
- The user will be able to submit a search request for a song title. 
- After the user presses the “submit” button to search for a song title, they will be redirected to the Submissions Page.
- At the Main Page, there will also be a button called “See Report” that allows the user to view the sentiment analysis report of all their requested songs (see user story 4). 
- At the bottom of the Main Page, there will be a logout button for the user to log out of the website. 


## Exception:
- If the user submits a search request for a song title that does not exist, we will show an error message that there is no song with the title that they requested.
